    ### Question 2: Initialize Git and Push to the Repo 

<!-- -->

-   From the terminal in RStudio, type git status to check what changes that we have made

-   Type git add . to stage the file

-   Type git commit -m " fill with meaningful commit messages"

-   Type git push origin main to push the changes that we have made to our main branch

-   Check our repo from github to make sure our push is already success

### Question 3: Create Branch, Modify File, and Push

-   Type `git checkout -b testbranch` from the terminal to create a new branch called testbranch as well as switch to the branch.

-   Modify the file to test, in this case I am modifying the file by typing the Question 3 command

-   Type `git status` in terminal to check whether git is tracking our changes then followed by `git add .` to stage the file and `git commit -m "pushing file to testbranch"`

-   Finish with command `git push origin testbranch` to push our changes to the branch
